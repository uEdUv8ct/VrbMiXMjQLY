                  1.1 This Privacy Policy details important information regarding the collection, use and disclosure of User information collected on the Site and the Tools. The aim of this Privacy Policy is to help you understand how your personal information is used and your choices regarding said use. By using the Site or the Tools, you agree that the Foundation can collect, use, disclose, and process your information as described in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy only applies to the Site and the Tools, and not to any other websites, products or services you may be able to access or link to via the Site or the Tools. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of any other websites you visit before providing your information to them.
                  </p>
                  <p class="section–description">
                  The Site and the Tools may evolve over time, and this Privacy Policy will change to reflect that evolution. If changes are made, you will be notified by revising the date at the top of this Privacy Policy. In some cases, if significant changes are made, a statement may be placed on the homepage. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed.

                  Some third–party providers may place cookies or pixels – small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory – on your browser or hard drive. Note that this Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies or pixels by such third parties. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies and pixels by default, but you can usually set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies or pixels. If you do choose to remove or reject cookies or pixels, however, your ability to use the Site or the Tools might be affected.

                  3.2 The DCL Client requires full browser permissions that could potentially be used to access additional personal information. Such browser permissions are used for an extremely limited technical purpose for allowing the DCL Client to properly interact with your browser. No additional information is obtained beyond what is necessary to provide the DCL Client. No information received is shared with any third–party except as required for the provision of the DCL Client.

Further, we may, from time to time, expand or reduce our business which may involve the transfer of certain divisions or assets of our company to other parties, and the data we store and use, where relevant, may be transferred to such third parties. From time to time we may transfer the data we store and use to locations outside the European Economic Area, some of which may have different data protection laws to the UK or the EU, or no data protection laws.

                  6.1 The Site and the Tools do not use cookies at this time but they might do so in the future, in which case this Privacy Policy shall be updated accordingly. <br>
                  6.2 We use cookies to distinguish you from other users of the AI2BC–AiProf and AI2BC–AiProf Website(s) and obtain certain information about your usage and behavior. A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers that we put on your computer when you use the AI2BC–AiProf App or AI2BC–AiProf DAO Website(s). This helps us to provide you with a better experience when you use the AI2BC–AiProf or browse the AI2BC–AiProf website(s) and also allows us to improve the Services. We will use both persistent cookies, which could remain on your device until their expiration (which, in some cases, is up to 10 years), and session cookies, which are temporary files removed from your device once your browser is closed. <br>
                  6.3 The types of cookies we may use include: <br>

                  • Analytical/Tracking Cookies, which allow us to recognize and count the number of visitors and analyze the use of the Services, as well as to verify transactions; and <br>
                  • Advertising and Retargeting Cookies, which allow us to generate appropriate advertising directed to you on the AI2BC–AiProf Website(s) as well as on the AI2BC–AiProf DAO App and other third–party. <br>

                  Please note that third parties (including, for example, advertising networks and providers of external services like web traffic analysis services) may also use cookies, over which we have no control. These cookies are likely to be analytical/performance cookies or targeting cookies. You may block cookies by activating the appropriate setting on your browser but, if you do so, you may not be able to use all functionalities of the Services. <br>

                  6.4 We use several industry–standard data analytics tools, such as Google Analytics and Facebook Analytics. These collect certain information about you, such as your device’s IP address and browsing and usage behavior, and are used to allow us to track and monitor the traffic visiting the AI2BC–AiProf App and AI2BC–AiProf website(s).
